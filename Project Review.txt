How to make Prediction model ???
	
	To Show a Student What next Path will be Better.
	
	What are the Features which we are going to consider :
	
		Features
		
		Marks
			B.Tech Semester Subject-wise
			10th & 12th 
		
		#	Marks of individual students will be considered
		#	Marks should be seen categorized subject field wise to know the Area of Interest and Performance in that area
		#	A Correlation will be made between Marks Subjected Field wise and Topic of Interests 
		#	Prediction will significantly be affected by the Correlation of Marks and Topic of Interest (taken by Student)
		
		Attendence
			B.Tech Semester Subject-wise
			
		#	A Correlation will be made between Attendence Topic Field wise and Topic of Interests (Keyword)
		
		Achievements
			Which Field ?
			
		Extra-Co (club activities)
			Which Field ?
			
		Projects/Internships Completed
			Which Field ?
		
		
	What will be our Training Dataset for the Algorithm ?
	
		Dataset Attributes Property:
			
			Fully Text-based Dataset
			Re-Occurance of certain word
			
		
		Dataset Attributes will be
			
			Marks Attendence
				Student Records
			
			Achievements
				???
			
			Extra Co (club activities)
				???
			
			Projects/Internships Completed
				???
	
		What are these Keywords ?
			
			#	Each Keyword represents a Particular Field whether it is broad or specific.
			#	Keywords are collection of All the Possible Fields which a Student can 
				be interested in, which will be extracted from Dataset Attributes.
			#	These Keyword are different fields which the Student is fond of.
			#	Keyword have atleast single correlation vector,i.e. we are assuming 
				the each field have atleast single similarity or Common factor between them.
			#	This Connection can be of Direct or InDirect form.
			#	If there is no direct correlation between two keywords then, they may be of 
				different cluster and correlation factor will be less then that are more nearer to the MAIN Keyword.
		
		How Keywords will be looked upon ?
		
			#	Keywords will be dependent on the students current Academic Status(like 3rd yr. Student,High School Student,etc.)
			# 	These keywords then will taken from the future possibilities of Student Career Path.
			
			// what i mean to say is a student will not study or show any interest 
				in Embedded System/Communication right then'n'there if he is enrolled 
				in 11th Class as Science Student.He will likely want to go for Engineering/Some other 
				which lead to that path CURRENTLY.
	
			
		How these Keywords will be used ?

			#	Keywords will be generated by surfing the datasets and will be extracted.
			#	They will noted along with the frequency of Occurance of Keyword.
			#	These Keywords has to be converted to Numerical format - Points.
			#	Each Keyword will assigned 1 point for each of its occurance through the training dataset.
			#	Each Keyword Should be GRAPHically represented, which means that graph
				will represent the relation/similarity between each other keyword which
				will be dealt with Natural Language Processing and A Graph Clustering Algorithm.
			#	Since, Each keyword will be correlated then, whenever a prediction
				will be made it will consider keywords highly correlated with the Most Pointed Keyword.

	What is Keyword-Point ?
		
		A Keyword-Point gives a single value output for defining relation between the Data Attribute.
		It can be mathematically modelled as :
			
			

	What is the Strategy to make Prediction ?
		
		Correlation between the training dataset and the topic of interests
		This Correlation data then will be used to make predictions
		Keywords will be in Graph form 
		Through Graph we can predict the Most Preferable path that is suited for partiular student
		
***	Correlation Between Keywords :
*	
*		This is a 2-D numerical value Matrix defining the probability that two keyword are related to each other.
*		These values will be available through Natural Language Toolkit.
*
***	Correlation Between Keywords and Attributes:
*		
*		This is a 2-D numerical value Matrix defining the #Occurance of Keywords in the 
*		particular Attribute.This matrix will generate Keyword-Points.
*	
***	Relationship Between Student and Keywords :
*		
*		This is a 2-D numerical value Matrix defining relation of Keyword-Points obtained
*		from Keyword-Attribute Matrix and particular Student.

	Possible Algorithm Ideas :
	
		How to make keyword Graph ?
		
		/1	Make a connected Directional Graph of the Keywords
		/2	Intially,In this Graph,Each Keyword will be fully connected with All the other keywords that are Present.
		/3	Initialize,Each edge of Graph with a Minimum weight,say 0.1
		/4	Make a DataMatrix representing Relationship between Attributes and Keywords for Each Student.
			//1	Each Matrix Value is correlation between 
		/5	Train and Update Graph with the Training dataset with Each of the Student DataMatrix.
			//1	Updating DataMatrix will require some UPDATE RULE
		/6	After training the Graph, Each Edge updated weight will either be Increased or Decreased or Remain Same.
		/7	Apply Threshholding over all the edges in the Graph to remove the weak edges.(optional,can cause data loss)
		/8	Remaining Graph will then be a correlation of Keyword with better possible path for future pursuation by the Student.

		Once, Generalised Keyword Graph is made,then
			
		/1	Test the Keyword Graph to Predict the Student Next Best Probable Keyword that should be pursued.

DataFlow of the Algorithm :
	_______________________________
	|		     	      |
	| Acquiring Data from Sources | -----> Data Attributes will be acquired from Sources 
	|_____________________________|		like FFCS,Surveys,etc.
			|		        Clean the Acquired raw data using R and make 
			|			it ready for processing.
			V
	______________________
	|		     |
	| Dataset Attributes | -----> Make Seperate DataSheets for Each Attribute
	|____________________|	      Make an Attribute DataSheet which will contain Quantified 
		  |			Data of each Attribute	
	          |		      These Sheets will provide or help in some Secondary Results 
	          V			like Collabration Portal,Performance Graph,etc. 
	_______________________

	| Keywords Extraction | -----> Make a Graph from the extracted Keywords with edge-weighted
	|_____________________|        Make Sheet that will contain a whole set of Categorized Keyword

	   | Keyword Graph | -----> This Keyword graph will be trained with the Training dataset.
	   |_______________|	    Clusters will be formed of sets of keyword which will belong 
	   	  |			to a Particular domain.
	          |		    Since, It is highly Unlikely a Student to Change A Whole 
	          V			Particular Domain rather than a Field in Domain.

	     | Results | -----> Highly Probable Field which Student should take in Future
